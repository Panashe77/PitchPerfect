      "content": "This Saturday there is a mouthwatering clash on the horizon with Brighton and Hove Albion facing off against Manchester United, in a match that looks to show the Champions League prospect pretenders from the real deal. Both teams have had quite a relatively impressive start to the season, especially if compared to both teams from last season at the same stage. \r\n\r\nBrighton has had a sort of renaissance this season with manager Dario Vidosic being given a new set of players that have proven to be effective in his hybrid playing system. The introduction of experienced internationals like Fran Kirby, Jelena Janković, and Nikita Parris has added a new dynamic to Brighton's playing style. This was more prevalent in their game against current league leaders; although the game ended in defeat, Brighton's players' belief in their philosophy of possession-style football was there to be seen. Man City looked to press Brighton high, targeting the two center-backs when the ball found its way to them. However, the way the Brighton players had faith in those center-backs and those around them to be able to play around the City attackers was a testament to not only their newfound confidence but also work on the training ground. The introduction of the new experienced players also played a massive role in the resilience of the team, with the team keeping a star-studded Man City side to a single goal and coming back strong against Aston Villa.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan United, on the other hand, was all about learning from the disappointments and mistakes of last season. After a strong 2022/2023 season, the team failed to meet those same standards, in part due to the departure of two of the team's main stars  Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle, both of whom were integral to their playing style. In terms of replacing the center forward gap left by Russo, which Melvine Malard failed to fulfill, they have looked to Elisabeth Terland, a signing that might be an indication of the positive direction the club is going in. Terland's goal-scoring record last season was quite exceptional and was on the radar of many clubs. An excellent signing that I think most people in the league missed is the signing of Dominique Janssen. Her experience and leadership qualities will come in good in a side that seems to have trouble getting out of intense pressure moments. The goalkeeping issue Man Utd had last season with Mary Earps' contract situation found a conclusion that I think benefits both parties in the end, with Earps going to PSG and Utd finally getting to play American goalkeeper Phallom Tullis-Joyce on a more permanent basis, a situation I believe will bring about a truly amazing keeper. Utd have had a near-perfect start, scoring multiple goals and keeping clean sheets in all their games. Marc Skinner's playing style is starting to take effect, and it looks like they are beginning to utilize the good attacking players they have on their hands.\r\n\r\nPrediction: 2-2 (Kirby, Parris, Terland, Miyazawa)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "All eyes on Stanford Bridge title clash",
      "content": "This Saturday marks a pivotal moment on the top end of the WSL with the two clubs who look to be the main contenders for the title going head to head. Chelsea faces Man City at Stanford Bridge at 19:45 cat, in a tie that promises to be a huge showing of the qualities of the WSL. \r\n\r\nBoth teams come into the tie with impressive results under their belts. Chelsea the hosts have had a historic start under new manager Sonia Bompastor, having a 100% record in the league winning all six of their encounters this season. What's been impressive is how they have been able to win these games and the different ways they have been able to do so. 23 goals scored in the league with 10 different goal scorers has sent the message to the league that the downward slump other teams hoped for is not happening but they have gotten better. Their wins away at Arsenal and Liverpool indicate a new start and leaving old demons behind. But it hasn't been all sunshine and berries as there have been instances where the team has allowed teams to take back control after an explosive start and defensively there have been a few cracks that teams have been able to exploit. \r\n\r\nMan City on the other hand bar an entertaining draw at Arsenal have won all their games, yes not having it all their way with the Aston Villa game coming into mind where the big hitters had to pull the magic out of the hat to gain the Citizens the three points. The most impressive part of City's season so far is their ability to use their midfield to not only control the tempo and intensity of the game but be the force from which the front players can use to put opposition teams to the sword. With 16 goals scored this season the Citizens front line has looked menacing, especially in those moments when the team is in a tough situation. Outside of the WSL their victory over Barcelona in the Champions League has probably been the best performance by a team in Europe this season and was a testament of what they can archive if they are at full throttle. \r\n\r\nKey Battles: Midfield: the midfield battle is probably where the game will be won or lost with the absolute best in the league coming to blows. On the Chelsea side, it probably will be Erin Cuthbert and Sjoeke Nüsken while the Citizens will be looking at Yui Hasegawa and Jess Park to bring the three points back to Manchester. Strikers: Both these teams are blessed with incredible attackers in the form of Kaditja Shaw and Mayra Ramirez. Shaw has just continued her incredible form from last season having recently broken the record for the most hatriks scored (3) against a single team in the WSL and has been a force to be reckoned with. Ramirez on the other hand is a player the WSL has never seen before a strong footballer with the technical ability to run hold-up play and dribble past and through players with ease. There is no place on the field you can contain her she can get it from deep with no problem, link up on the edge of the box, or run in behind with blistering strength. \r\n\r\nPrediction: Chelsea 3 - 1 Man City\r\n",

      "title": "Is the Blue machine just too good to be stopped?",
      "content": "Chelsea's start this season has been impressive and historic. It's a perfect start, with 11 matches won, the most goals scored in the league, and the second-best defensive record to boast.\r\n\r\nIt leaves the question, can anyone stop this machine in its tracks or are other WSL teams just small bumps in the way of an unstoppable force? Realistically speaking they have already played their toughest games of the first half of their season, two away games to their so-called bogey teams in Arsenal and Liverpool, and their game against their closest challenges from last season. It looks like this season again. The games I just mentioned were relatively comfortable for the Blues with my belief being that if they needed to they could have gone up a gear in each one. The game that's left that you could have looked at at the beginning of the season and thought that's a tough game is the rescheduled Man Utd game this Sunday and even that if you looking from a historical point of view should be a relatively comfortable day put for the blues. \r\n\r\nSo the question arises what can be done to stop Chelsea? Well I believe it's going to take two things, firstly teams being more willing to take risks against and maybe ironically playing the football that Hayes Implemented with the Blues, being direct and getting the ball as fast as possible to the attackers, Chelsea have shown that they are comfortable with teams playing in front of the back line and they know they have the players to dictate when and where the possession of the opposition goes, so I think maybe try to catch that Chelsea defensive line before they settle could unlock that defense. The second way is that managers are going to have to study Bompastor's games at Lyon and look for those rare instances where the Lyon team lost one or two games and see if they can use that as a way to stop this incredible manager. \r\n\r\nEither way, I believe that other teams in the WSL risk being left behind cause one thing is for sure Chelsea is not stopping or resting on their morals, they have a target which is the Champions League, and they are not going to stop until they get it and once they do I'm sure those above at the club will make sure they can hold onto it as long as they can.\r\n",
